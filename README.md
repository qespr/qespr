# Left for greaner pastures...

Almost everywhere it's better than here, it really is. [Give up github](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/) has some nice points, here are also some of my persnoal reasons:

### Problems with GitHub

- Github:
  - Is the place to go for "Open Source" projects while needing proprietary javascript being served by proprietary backend
  - Is using Copilot to turn your hard work into potentionally locked down proprietary project
- Other reasons:
  - Such insane centralization (especially when controlled by Microsoft) is a problem, probably everyone can agree on that
  - Microsoft ""loves"" open source and ""Loves"" Linux but not enough to
    - [Give .NET core license that can protect you from possible patent trolling](https://isdotnetopen.com)
    - Stop constantly trying to push Linux development to Github ([and so restricting access to all the blocked people](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/github-ban-sanctioned-countries/))
    - Make .NET core debugger on Linux (but they'll hapily port Teams and other mallware for you!)
    - Port Minecraft bedrock edition to Linux
    - Stop financing [FUD](http://techrights.org/o/2023/01/02/analytics-india-magazine-is-fud/) sites
  - There is also big potential for EEE attack on git with the ``gh`` command specific to github

### Alternatives

- [Fergejo](https://forgejo.org/) Soon may have federation support
- [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) Soon may have federation support
- [SourceHut](https://sourcehut.org/)
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
- [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/)

### But everyone is here!

Because *you* are here as well. Github really is like Facebook of software development, and you can also be one of the people who leave before Microsoft does some colosal fuck up
